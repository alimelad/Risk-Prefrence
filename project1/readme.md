# Stag Hunt Game with Risk Aversion

## **Overview**
This project implements a **Stag Hunt game** with modifications to account for player risk aversion. This implementation adds a utility transformation step to study how risk aversion affects strategic behavior and Nash equilibria.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Strategic-Form Game Creation**:
   - Two players with two strategies each (`Stag` and `Hare`).
   - Monetary payoffs represent the benefits of cooperation (`Stag`) versus individual safety (`Hare`).
   
2. **Utility Transformation**:
   - Payoffs are transformed into utility values using an **exponential utility function** to model risk aversion.
   - A tunable risk-aversion parameter allows experimentation with different levels of player risk aversion.

3. **Nash Equilibria Analysis**:
   - Solves for both **pure** and **mixed strategy Nash equilibria**.
   - Explores how risk preferences affect equilibrium outcomes.
